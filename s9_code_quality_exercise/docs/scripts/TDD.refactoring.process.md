# TDD Production Code Refactoring Process

STARTER_CHARACTER = 🟣

This process is for refactoring production code.
Only refactor one thing.
## Steps
  1. Choose and perform the simplest possible refactoring (one at a time).
  2. Write a commit message to the file `commit.txt` with the message format: "- r <refactoring>" (quotes must include the - r).

## Code Style
- Prefer self-explanatory, readable code over comments.
- Use functional helper methods for clarity.
- Remove comments and dead code.
- Extract paragraphs into methods.
- Use better variable names.
- Remove unused imports.
- Remove unhelpful local variables
